<!-- v0.1 -->
## [v0.1] - 2023-08-23

### Added

- Initialized the project.
- Vehicle module:
  - Added `vehicle_builder.py` file: Provides methods to retrieve information and control all vehicles in the scene.
  - Added `vehicle.py` file: Defines the `VehicleInfo` class that represents information about a vehicle.
- Aircraft module:
  - Added `aircraft.py` file: Defines the `AircraftInfo` class that represents information about an aircraft.
  - Added `aircraft_builder.py` file: Provides methods to create and control aircraft.


<!-- v0.2 -->
## [v0.2] - 2023-08-25

### Added

- Added `generate_detectors.py` file in the `sumo_tools` module
  - `base_detectors.py`: Defines the information retrieval from intersections and the `generate_detector` method.
  - `e1_detectors.py`: Generates e1 detectors placed at a default distance of 2m from the traffic lights.
  - `e2_detectors.py`: Generates e2 detectors with a default length of 100m.
  - `e3_detectors.py`: Generates e3 detectors that cover turns.
- Added `sumo_infos` in the `sumo_tools` module to extract connections of traffic light signals.

### Changed

- Modified `init_log.py` in the `utils` section to store logs in a separate folder.
- Modified `get_abs_path.py` in the `utils` section to include the SIM identifier in the logs.


<!-- v0.3 -->
## [v0.3] - 2023-08-28

### Added

- Added traffic light module
  - `traffic_light_action_type.py`: Defines two types of traffic light control: "Choose Next Phase" and "Next or Not".
  - `traffic_light.py`: Defines the basic properties and methods of each traffic light.
  - `traffic_light_builder.py`: Initializes all traffic lights in a scene and defines interfaces for accessing information and control.
  - `choose_next_phase.py`: Defines the control method "Choose Next Phase".
  - `next_or_not.py`: Defines the control method "Next or Not".

### Changed

- Modified the vehicle module to no longer create multiple classes for the same vehicle.
  - Added `update_vehicle_feature`, which updates the current information of the vehicle at each step.
  - Added and improved different vehicle action types, including `lane` and `lane with continuous speed`.
  - Added attributes to the vehicle, including `action type` and `lane index`.

<!-- v0.4 -->
## [v0.4] - 2023-08-30

### Add

- Added four different aircraft action types:
  - `stationary.py`: The aircraft remains stationary at its initial position.
  - `horizontal_movement.py`: The aircraft can only move horizontally, with eight possible heading angles.
  - `vertical_movement.py`: The aircraft can only move vertically, with three possible heading values: up, stationary, and down.
  - `combined_movement.py`: The aircraft can move both upward and downward simultaneously, combining azimuth and pitch angles. There are a total of 40 combinations.

### Changed

- Added `base_builder.py` to standardize the interface between different builders:
  - `aircraft_builder.py`, `vehicle_builder.py`, `traffic_light_builder.py`
- Provided examples for vehicle, aircraft, and traffic light under the new builder:
  - `traffic_light_action`: `tls_choosenextphase.py` and `tls_nextornot.py`
  - `aircraft_actions`: `aircraft_combined.py`, `aircraft_horizontal.py`, `aircraft_stationary.py`, and `aircraft_vertical.py`
  - `vehicle_action`: `vehicle_lane.py` and `vehicle_lane_with_continuous_speed.py`

### Fixed

- In `traffic_light.py`, set `this_phase` to False before each update in `__update_this_phase()`. Previously, it would cause all `this_phase` values to be True.

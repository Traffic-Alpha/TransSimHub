Aircraft RGB Sensor
===================

Within the simulated environment of TSHub3D, the aircraft's RGB sensor offers a unique perspective for traffic monitoring and autonomous driving research. This section will elaborate on the sensor effects of the aircraft in three distinct flight modes.

Aircraft Vertical Flight
-----------------------------

In the vertical flight mode, the aircraft can ascend and descend vertically, altering the shooting angle and field of view. As the aircraft ascends, the observable area expands, yet the details of objects become less distinct. Conversely, as the aircraft descends, more detailed information can be captured.

Aircraft Horizontal Flight
--------------------------------

In the horizontal flight mode, the aircraft rotates around intersections, allowing us to dynamically observe the surroundings of the intersection from various angles.

Aircraft Vehicle Following
---------------------------------

The third mode involves the aircraft following specific vehicles, enabling close aerial observation and documentation of the vehicle's surroundings and interactions.

With these sensor configurations, TSHub3D provides researchers with a comprehensive tool for traffic monitoring, allowing analysis of traffic situations from the perspective of ground vehicles as well as supplemental aerial perspectives, aiding in a deeper understanding of traffic flow and driving behaviors.

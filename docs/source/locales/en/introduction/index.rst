TransSimHub Introduction
===========================

TransSimHub (TSHub) is a Python library for simulating air-land traffic using SUMO. It provides a range of powerful tools and models for scenario creation, real-time retrieval, and control of vehicles, aircraft, and traffic lights.

Key Features
------------

- **Scenario Creation**: Includes automated tools for generating mixed traffic flows and laying out detectors at intersections.
- **Air-Land Integration**: Provides interfaces for retrieving information and controlling vehicles, aircraft, and traffic lights.
- **Reinforcement Learning Support**: TransSimHub is compatible with the Gym library interface and integrates with the rllib reinforcement learning framework.

With TransSimHub, you can easily create complex scenarios, interact with vehicles and aircraft in real-time, and leverage reinforcement learning algorithms for advanced control and optimization.

Installation
------------

To install TransSimHub, please refer to the :doc:`../installation/index` section.

Next, let's explore the capabilities of TransSimHub and learn how to use it effectively.

.. note::
   If you encounter any issues during the installation process or while using TransSimHub, refer to the project's documentation or seek help from the community.
